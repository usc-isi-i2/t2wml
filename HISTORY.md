T2WML Standalone Server App History
===================================

Changes in version 2.11.0:
------------------------
* t2wml-api 0.6.2
* a virtualized table capable of handling large files (tested on ~400,000 rows and ~60 columns)
* performance improvements to support the virtualized table
* no need to press submit when making changes in an existing block
* add load time for slower macs

Changes in version 2.10.2:
------------------------
* t2wml-api 0.5.6
* clearer flow of UI and other UI tweaks
* some additional bug fixes, including:
   - fix bug where property is auto-selected after deleting wikification for cell
   - fix bug where apply to block worked incorrectly when applying a custom node
   - fixed property type is always string in cell menu
   - when downloading zipped results, don't crash if one file can't output results
* display an error when wikification fails
* do not prompt for file path when creating new empty yaml/annotation file
* some (significant) backend performance improvements when using custom properties. this seems to have also partially improved the extreme slowness of uploading old-style wikifier files to a project.
* add option to upload entities file in project menu

Changes in version 2.10.1:
------------------------
* fixes to multiple bugs (#487, #490, #491, #492, #493)


Changes in version 2.10.0:
------------------------
* t2wml-api version 0.5.0 (NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE)

* complete overhaul of UI. 
   - The entire left panel was removed/replaced with a tabbed control for block, cell, output preview, and yaml. various fields were added to the block and cell tabs with the added room (mostly related to changes in wikification, below)
   - the modes were removed from the table, the table is now one combined table
   - download button has been moved to file sidebar. entities filetree has been removed, there is only the main project file tree now.
   - upload to datamart button removed
   - wikify region button removed
   - upload wikifier button moved to project menu, see below complete overhaul of wikification
   - Show nodes toggle has been added to project menu. Show cleaned toggle has been removed for now-- will be added back once the cleaning feature is more mature.

* complete overhaul of wikification. NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE. 
   - when loading old projects, the backend will try to convert old wikifier files to the new style -- this process may take a long time. it may be more efficient to remove the wikifier files from the project.t2wml file, and then re-upload by hand as needed
   - upload wikifier added to project menu. this allows uploading old-style wikifier files, and having them converted to the new style. 
   - the new style is a file per datafile in the project folder / sub folder "wikifiers", and col+row+ file name + sheet name are all required columns. ALL wikification is saved to this file, instead of multiple wikification files being able to be applied to the same sheet. a specific cell cannot have multiple rows in the wikification file.
   - can send a block to wikifier service 
   - can send a block to have nodes auto-created (automatic auto-creation has been removed)
   - can delete wikification on a block or cell level
   - can create custom nodes, for a cell, or for the property/unit/main subject of a block
   - as before, can search for existing nodes and hand-wikify cells
   - blue/orange text for blocks that have been wikified/are lacking needed wikification

* added ability to download a zipped file of all mapping file outputs from the project

* when adding a data file, mode defaults to annotation
* changes to how output preview displays nodes, adding urlification for value field and general handling of label and parentheses
   - this includes a bug fix where units were being displayed as junk

* add environment variable T2WMLHOME. when set, the .t2wml folder will be created there rather than in the os home. 
   - fix a bug where program would error out if .t2wml folder was deleted mid run
* errors:
   - when a request to backend fails because it attempts to modify a file that is open elsewhere (eg excel), return a coherent error to user

Changes in version 2.8.0: 
-------------------------
* t2wml-api version 0.2.4
* added property search bar in the annotation menu for dependent variables and qualifiers
* added wikify mode:
   - in wikify mode, a cell's wikification is displayed in the cell, with label and description, allowing the user to easily see at a glance what QNodes/properties a cell is linked to
   - in wikify mode the user can select a cell, or a cell within a block defined by the annotation, search for an appropriate wikidata QNode or Property, and apply it to that cell or all cells with the same content in the block.
   - for qnode (not property) search, the user can specify a P31 node to filter the results of their query
   - the user wikifications are saved to a file in the project
   - users can also remove any wikification they've added
* the entities tab of the file tree has some enhancements:
   - entity and wikifier files are no longer displayed alaphabetically, but rather in the order they are present in the project, which is also their order by precedence (ascending, ie last is highest precedence)
   - the ability to add files has been added to the right click menu
* bug fix: previously, changes to wikification (eg adding a new wikifier file) were not being displayed/updated in the results. this has been fixed, and all wikification changes-- adding and deleting files, auto-generation from annotation, and anything done in wikify mode-- will be displayed in the table and results.
* the wikify button has been disabled. the wikifier endpoint is currently down for an unknown amount of time.


Changes in version 2.7.1:
-------------------------
* t2wml-api version 0.2.2
* signed electron executables for Mac and Windows
* when opening t2wml from path, t2wml command exits after opening the application

* t2wml-api version 0.2.1
* upload to datamart button behavior has changed. it is currently in BETA mode. It will only work with a locally run version of datamart, running on branch itay/t2wml-shortcut. you must change the datamart endpoint in global settings to point to the local version.
* right-click menu added to file tree. 
   * data, annotation, and yaml files can be 
      - renamed (includes support for moving around project internal directories, ie annotations/filename.json will locate it in annotations sub-directory)
      - removed from project (without deleting), 
      - deleted, 
      - opened in filesystem. 
   * sheets have:
      - add annotation/yaml (empty, will overwrite existing files if selected)
      - open existing annotation/yaml (will add to the specified sheet, including copying into project if not in project yet)
* missing properties/items are auto-generated during annotations and added to an autogenerated entity file in the project
* project/entities menu option added. opens an entity window which lists all custom entities (properties/items) in the project (whether auto-generated or uploaded from the add entities button). Entities can be edited from this window (project must be reloaded to show changes)

* complete revamp of the file sidebar, which is now permanently displayed (but resizable)
   * file navigation with click
   * active files bolded
   * file tree is the only way to navigate between annotation and yaml files, the yaml file switcher has been removed
   * file tree has icons for file types, hover for full file name, arrow collapsing
* annotation files are now fully featured mapping files (like yaml files) ie can be used to create output statements etc
   * note: if an annotation is invalid (no dependent variable + main subject), it will not create any statements or colors in output mode
* the annotation mode checkbox is now a toggle. it is on annotation mode by default. 
   * selecting annotation mode while on a yaml file in the tree will switch to most recently used annotation file or create one if there isn't one already
* various UI tweaks:
   * download has been renamed "Save to file"
   * in the table legend, data has been renamed to dependent variable and majorError/minorError now have spaces

Changes in version 2.5.0:
-----------------------
* t2wml-api version 0.0.20
* Major new feature: UI support for user annotations. For now only a single annotation per sheet is supported.
* Various minor UI features accompany the main one, for example it is now possible to scroll through the table with the arrow keys 
* table separated into multiple table components
* 'add t2wml to PATH' menu item added in help menu. once invoked, you can run t2wml from the command line, and if you pass it a directory argument (including . for current directory, or relative paths from current directory) t2wml will either create a project for that directory or open an existing project if there is one. please note that linux and windows machines may require user to log out and log back in to register the change to path.
* fixed bug where it was impossible to have an empty yaml

Some known bugs related to the major changes that we are already aware of and plan on fixing in the next release:
* when switching between annotation and regular mode, the regular mode yaml will be applied, but the content in the yaml window will not be updated. 
* we removed some of the yaml switching functionality (eg the plus button for adding a new, empty yaml)
* annotations over empty cells outside of the boundaries of the data (ie at edges of spreadsheet) do weird things

The next release is planned to include a complete overhaul of the file management and mode switching, which is why we decided not to delay this release over these issues.

MASSIVE Backwards compatibility breaking change. API moved to its own package. Database completely refactored.

If you have installed a version prior to this one, and are now installing this or subsequent versions in the same virtual environment, you will need to manually delete your database. 

run `pip uninstall t2wml-standalone` 

You should see a list of files that will be removed, followed by:

> Would not remove (might be manually added):

> {ENV DIR}\lib\site-packages\backend\app.db

where {ENV DIR} is your environment directory

if you do not remove the app.db file, then you will get the following fatal error message when attempting to launch the t2wml server:

> ERROR [root] Error: Can't locate revision identified by 'a19320d46380'

* json format changed from list of dicts to dict
* cell-specific errors when parsing template no longer raise error and exit.
  instead, they are added to a dictionary of errors, which is both printed to stderr and returned in the results
     * the only exception is errors in the first cell of the data, as that cell is used to verify validity of the template itself, and will immediately exit with error if invalid
* performance improvements to uploading property files
* performance improvements to calculating statements and to downloading kgtk results
* bug fixes:
   * 500 error when uploading properties file in json format

Changes in version 2.0a12:
